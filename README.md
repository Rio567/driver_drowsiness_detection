# driver_drowsiness_detection
Developed a Real-Time Drowsiness Detection System: Utilized OpenCV, Dlib, and NumPy to create a system capable of detecting drowsiness by analyzing eye blink patterns through a webcam feed.

Implemented Facial Landmark Detection: Employed Dlib's pre-trained 68-point facial landmark model to accurately locate key facial features essential for blink detection and drowsiness analysis.

Eye Blink Ratio Calculation: Developed algorithms to compute eye blink ratios and categorize them into three states—active, drowsy, and sleeping—based on threshold values.

Visual Feedback and Alerts: Provided real-time visual feedback by drawing facial landmarks and status indicators on video frames, enhancing user interaction and alerting for potential drowsiness.

Optimized for Real-Time Performance: Ensured efficient processing and responsiveness of the system, making it suitable for applications in driver monitoring, workplace safety, and fatigue management.
